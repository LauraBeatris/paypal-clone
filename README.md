**Question:** What are the tecnologies used in this project?

**Answer:** The tecnologies used in this project are [React](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/) + [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) to handle scoped CSS.

I'm also using [SWR](https://swr.now.sh/) in order to easily cache and mutate the transactions data.
